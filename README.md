#This as an automated flashable kernel zip generator.
Put the folder in your home directory (should look like this: ~/mkflashable/).
Run it by:
mkflashable [pathtoboot.img]

The signed zip can be found at the out folder, the matching md5sum at the md5 folder.


The signapk tool wasn't created by me. You can find more information [here](https://code.google.com/p/signapk/).
